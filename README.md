##  Simple Retrofit Coroutines to get data from API  
**API URL :**  
I use it [TheSportDB](https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json/1/all_leagues.php)

this is a little piece of result:  
```json
{
	"leagues": [{
			"idLeague": "4328",
			"strLeague": "English Premier League",
			"strSport": "Soccer",
			"strLeagueAlternate": "Premier League"
		},
		{
			"idLeague": "4329",
			"strLeague": "English League Championship",
			"strSport": "Soccer",
			"strLeagueAlternate": "Championship, Sky Bet Championship"
		}
	]
}
```
